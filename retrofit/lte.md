You can reuse your old gyro, I did...

New modem will bolt into same 3 mount points.  Dont worry the 2 for the side gyro is in different spot.  MAKE sure you connect GPS antenna on connector labeled GPS.  Once again dont ask me why I know this.  You will need T20 bit to remove 18 screws, 12 that secure screen to chassis, and 6 that secure trim to mcu.  I flipped the trim around as I opened so I didn't have to cut the zip tie for bluetooth antenna .  Not removing the bluetooth antenna makes it a little harder to change the modem, have a helper stedy the MCU or prop it with things.  Then put back in car and good to go.
